This is a PHP port of Ryan Pearl's (@rpearl) python-zxcvbn port 
which itself is a port of Dan Wheeler's (@lowe) zxcvbn, which is 
a JavaScript password strength generator. 

Refer to the original JavaScript (well, actually CoffeeScript) 
implementation which can be found at:
https://github.com/lowe/zxcvbn

NB: This is quick & dirty port(TM) to PHP as a starting point.
You probably don't want to use this in production code, yet.

To see it in action, run:
php example.php
